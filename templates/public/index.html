    <h1>GetBeaned, a discord bot to moderate your discord servers</h1>

    GetBeaned is the only bot you'll ever need to moderate your server. Why ? The primary feature is the <strong>AutoModerator</strong>. But wait, it's not like the Dyno or MEE6
    automod, it's
    way more advanced and got less false-positives.

                        How does it work ?

                        The automoderator works by calculating a multiplicator, that represent how likely a user is there to spam. Using multiple data points, such as the Discord
                        Nitro status of the user, the account age and how long ago the user joined, GetBeaned is able to have a pretty good estimate of the spam-potential of an user.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After calculating the multiplicator, GetBeaned will then look at the specific message to determine if it could be considered as spam, using factors such as
                        the presence of CAPS, swear words, failed @everyone pings, ...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, by multiplying the multiplicator and the message score, GetBeaned apply actions corresponding to a specific total score.

                        Have you ever been on a server, and when trying to send a message quickly after another one, or just with a few CAPS letters, only to see it get removed by a
                        too strict moderation bot, while, at the same time in another channel, a user is spamming mentions without getting banned ? Well, if you don't want that to
                        happen on your
                        server,
                        <strong>GetBeaned is the solution!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A user that just joined and that try to post invite links should be treated as a spammer while a trusted user that has been there for a year shouldn't. And
                        that's what the
                        GetBeaned AutoModerator does.

                        You can configure GetBeaned on the webinterface, by logging in with discord. However, the defaults provided are quite good, and just enabling Thresholds and automod should get you started!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, if you need, more than 60 configuration variables are available, so customising the bot shouldn't be a problem
